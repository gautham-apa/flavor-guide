# Flavor Guide
An iOS app for interfacing food recipes from TheMealDB

## About
This app pulls data from the desserts category of TheMealDB API. It has a primary view to display a glimpse of all desserts and a secondary detail view. 
MVVM architecture was followed with swift concurrency(Async/Await) for the app construction with a decoupled network layer.
